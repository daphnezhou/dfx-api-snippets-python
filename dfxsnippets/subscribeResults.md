# subscribeResults

This class shows one way of receiving the results for a `measurementID` by
creating a subscribed channel to the DFX API server via WebSockets.

*One may receive multiple results if one sends multiple data chunks.
The intermediate results may have less result signals than the final result
depends on the duration of each chunk and the number of chunks*

It depends upon the following packages:

```python
import asyncio  # Python asynchronous io
import os       # For joining paths
import uuid     # Used to generate uuid

from google.protobuf.json_format import ParseDict # used to parse python dictionary to protobuf
from dfxsnippets.measurement_pb2 import SubscribeResultsRequest # compiled version of the protobuf request to subscribe to the results
```

## Basic usage

Create the `subscribeResults` object with a `measurementID`, a token,
a `websocketHandler` object, number of chunks, and an optional output folder.

```python
sub = subscribeResults(measurementID, token, websocketobj, num_chunks, out_folder=folder)
```

Add the `subscribe()` method to the event loop:

```python
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(sub.subscribe())
```

*Note: You may receive multiple results if you sends multiple data chunks.
The intermediate results may have fewer result signals than the final result
depends on the duration of each chunk and the number of chunks*

## Understanding the class

### Constructor

Let's examine the constructor of the Class. It requires a `measurementID` (the one you
already have in addData and expecting result), a `token` issued by the DeepAffex server,
a `websocketHandler` object, the total number of chunks `num_chunks` you sent to the
server(so it knows when to disconnect) in use, and an optional output folder `out_folder`
for writing the output files.

```python
def __init__(self, measurementID:str, token:str, websocketobj:websocketHandler, num_chunks:int, out_folder:str=None):
    self.measurementID = measurementID
    self.token = token
    self.ws_url = websocketobj.ws_url
    self.num_chunks = num_chunks
    self.requestData = None
    self.ws_obj = websocketobj
    self.out_folder = out_folder

    if self.out_folder and not os.path.isdir(self.out_folder):
        os.mkdir(self.out_folder)
```

Note that if no `out_folder` is specified at input, no output is saved.
If the specified output folder is nonexistent, it would create the folder.

### `prepare_data`

The `prepare_data` method is used to prepare the request data that need to
be sent through the WebSocket.

```python
def prepare_data(self):
    data = {}
    wsID = self.ws_obj.ws_ID  # Get websocket ID from the WebsocketHandler object
    requestID = uuid.uuid4().hex[:10]
    data['RequestID'] = requestID
    data['Query'] = {}
    data['Params'] = dict(ID=self.measurementID)

    websocketRouteID = '0510'
    requestMessageProto = ParseDict(
        data, SubscribeResultsRequest(), ignore_unknown_fields=True)
    self.requestData = f'{websocketRouteID:4}{wsID:10}'.encode(
    ) + requestMessageProto.SerializeToString()  # Data to be sent
```

As mentioned in the DFX API documentation, you will need to provide a unique
`requestID` (for destinguishing between different WebSocket connections you
have), the `websocketRouteID` (*510* for `subscribeResult` mentioned in the API
documentation), and the `measurementID` as a dictionary to `'Params'`.

It then uses the protobuf definition (compiled version) and the `SerializeToString()`
provided by protobuf to create the data to be sent and put it into the WebSocket
request data's `[10:]` buffer. The `[0:4]` is the unique WebSocket ID.


### `subscribe`

In the `subscribe()` method, we prepare the data and call `handle_send`, aynchronously.
This sends the prepared `requestData` prepared above through websocket asynchronously.

```python
await self.prepare_data()
await self.ws_obj.handle_send(self.requestData)
```

It then polls continuously until all the chunks have been received, indicated by a counter.
It checks two stacks, `self.ws_obj.subscribeStats` for confirmation messages, and
`self.ws_obj.chunks` for payload chunks, and handles each case differently.

```python
counter = 0
while counter < self.num_chunks:
    await self.ws_obj.handle_recieve()
    if self.ws_obj.subscribeStats:  # If a confirmation status is received
        response = self.ws_obj.subscribeStats[0]
        self.ws_obj.subscribeStats = []
        statusCode = response[10:13].decode('utf-8')
        if statusCode != '200':  # Error
            print("Status:", statusCode)

    elif self.ws_obj.chunks:  # If a chunk is received
        counter += 1
        response = self.ws_obj.chunks[0]
        self.ws_obj.chunks = []
        print("Data received; Chunk: "+str(counter) + "; Status: "+str(statusCode))
        if self.out_folder:     # Save only if an output folder is specified
            with open(self.out_folder + '/result_' + str(counter) + '.bin', 'wb') as f:
                f.write(response[13:])
```

If a "connection established" confirmation is received in `self.ws_obj.subscribeStats`
(usually the first response only), we can ignore it unless there is an error.

The actual result is the `[13:]` part and we can just save them into the
`self.output_folder` specified so you can call SDK to decode later:

```python
with open(self.out_folder + '/result_' + str(counter) + '.bin', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(response[13:])
```
